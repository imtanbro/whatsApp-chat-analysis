24/03/20, 9:55 pm - Aman Mulani: Good Evening Everyone!!!
So, it now official. The country is in lockdown for the next 21 days. 
It’s really disheartening as we humans have the primal instinct of socializing. I understand it’s not easy to perform social isolation, but it’s far easy than being dead. It’s a humble request to all that please comply with the rules. 
That’s not it, according to one article which I read just now on Business Insider, it stated that the world will take years to come up from this economy shake-up. It is being compared to The Great Depression of 1930. 
Well why I am stating this?
Because once we pass through this threat, the real crisis will begin. As it is said that the after effects of a storm are much dreadful than the storm itself. Let is be prepared to witness the biggest economic downfall of this century.
24/03/20, 9:55 pm - Aman Mulani: What must we do now?
Here’s the silver lining. You have got a complete of 21 days to focus on yourself. During this prepare yourself for what’s coming. This will never happen again. Believe me, we will never get such a long period of time just to improve ourselves. Let’s make a complete use of it. I don’t find a better opportunity than this to introduce all of you to this. We have been developing a little online community(thanks to Ali, TE) where we have students who have a good hold on various software related things such as Native Android App development, Web Development, Website Scrapping, Machine Learning, Cross-Platform App development, Core programming languages such as Java, Python, Arduino, IoT, Cyber Security and much more. 
Here’s my request to all. Let’s start working on ourselves. 
“Phoenix is reborn from its ashes. Similarly, greatest feats are achieved in the darkest of times.”
Here’s the link to the group:

31/03/20, 6:06 pm - Naresh Sir: Dear Prof. Nareshkumar R.M.

Since the entire world is under the grips of COVID-19 and has impacted the students in a broader way, IncubateIND is working on the directives by AICTE that has talked about encouraging students to take up projects, participate in online coding challenges/Hackathons and take up virtual internships in the form of live training/projects etc.

We are currently running 2 such initiatives on our platform, we are seeking ideas and solutions to eradicate or lessen the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian economy and the partner company Here Technologies is giving away rewards, internships and grants to the selected ideas. 


I am writing this email to invite students from DYPIEMR, Akurdi to submit their solutions for this online Hackathon, the website link for the same is www.incubateind.com/covid19

We are also working with various startups and running virtual internships on IncubateIND Uprise, we wanted to request you to encourage students to use this time to learn and work on real industry projects. Students could look at the internship opportunities on uprise.incubateind.com and apply directly.

I will be happy to get on a call and explain this initiative to you in a detailed manner.

Look forward to your feedback.

Regards
Punit Jain

03/04/20, 2:08 pm - Tanmay Gangurde: Thank u @919096942668
03/04/20, 2:18 pm - Suwarna Patil Ma'am: 📌 *It was observed that while attending live lectures on zoom students are behaving inappropriately.* 

🛑 *Strict action will be taken on all those students.* It is not at all difficult for us to trace any particular notorious student.

✅To avoid any strict action further, following things should be *STRICTLY* followed:

🚫 Using annotations drawing anything on white board during the lecture is strictly prohibited.

🚫 Making annoying noise when any teacher is teaching, is strictly prohibited. If you have background noises, mute yourself and try not to disturb speaker and other sincere listeners. 

🚫 While joining any zoom meeting hereafter you have to write your complete name along with your class and roll no in following format.
  _*div_roll no : name_of_student*_
Ex. *A01 : Prinkal Gangrade* should be your name while joining the zoom meeting. Other named listeners will be removed from the meeting.

🚫 Do not share lecture link 🔗 with any other student (other than DYPIEMR). We are taking efforts for you and not for your outside friends.

🚫 Do not try to unmute yourself if the speaker has muted you. 

🚫 Do not play any inappropriate songs in the background while the lecture is going on. 

*If any student found doing any of the above activity inappropriately, strict action will be taken on him/her.*

✳ _*Being a good human, try to follow some professional ethics while attending online lectures.*_ 

🔺Kindly value your course 
🔺  Value your teacher
🔺 Value your time

🚫 If you dont want dont attend lectures.

Thank you. 👍🏻

Hoping you and your family is well and enjoying quarantine time.💃
As modiji announced about lockdown we all are locked inside our houses🥺🥺 it feels like we all are in jail with VIP treatments like TV, tasty home made food like the dalgona coffee trending nowadays.😂😂
🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌻🌻🌻🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼
As you know how foodie you are.After every 2 hrs you have to eat and for that you have to go outside the house for buying groceries,vegetables, fruits.

 Because of this people gather at one place. This causes increase in social contact and it creates path for virus to spread.
So here we are  introducing an idea.
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
We made an to app which connects vendor and customer. Our Goal is to ensure that people stay in home and least number of people go out for buying the essentials.

In these lazy days we were getting bored 😅😅so we decided to participated in Mega Innovation challenge,
SAMADHAN" organized by MHD & AICTE to pitch our ideas for the fight against CoVid -19.
As we know there are many mis-information about the no. of covid patients around our locality
 and lack of proper autentic data .So we made an app that will serve this purpose.

*“Given the nature of the crisis, all hands should be on deck, all available tools should be used,”*

Hi there, let's cut the chase 🏃🏻‍♂️🏃🏼‍♀️ and get down to the main point, since there is an epidemic ☠️ going on right now and we still don't have a cure for it so we need to follow some basic steps.😎
       As we know, Prevention is better than Cure 🌅, we the team *rUnTiMe tErRoR* guided by Prof. Suvarna Patil , Prof. Manisha Bhende and Prof. Rashmi Deshpande have developed a system called _*Corona and Isolation Paradox*_ for maintaining Social distancing,  to avoid the transmission of COVOID-19-the novel coronavirus.

🔺🔻🔺🔻🔺🔻🔺🔻🔺🔻🔺🔻
     
The system is explained in the video whose link is given below 😄

It's really inspiring how Suraj has implemented his knowledge! There's something which we all can learn from it. How to get out of the Tutorial thing? In lockdown we have been doing lots of tutorial to get first hand knowledge. But you know what? It's a downward spiral...

06/05/20, 12:08 pm - Aman Mulani: Okay ma'am
06/05/20, 12:16 pm - Aman Mulani: Good Afternoon Everyone!
I was just going through one of the surveys conducted by LinkedIn, and it stated that,
_Companies won't be opening positions for managerial posts, instead there will be skill based posts_
Well after reading this, ot seems that getting all the tech stuff done right might just land you a dream job. Here's the irony:
Here skill based jobs mean: Technical + Interpersonal Skills. You heard it right. 
The best way to learn new interpersonal skills is through experiences. Here's the kick: 
_When we are left to our own experiences, we constantly suffer from shortage of data_.

The best way to get insights of some else's experience is through reading books.
Believe me, it is the best thing which you can gift to yourself.
06/05/20, 12:18 pm - Aman Mulani: Here's some books to get started with:
Atomic Habits by James Clear

Where Do Good Ideas Come From by Steven Johnson

Start With Why by Simon Sinek

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Stephen Covey

Leaders Eat Last by Simon Sinek

The 5AM Club by Robin Sharma

Chanakyaneeti (though a little controversial)

All skills are acquirable, it's just a matter about when you start with it!
Have a good day.

Imperial Education, in association with D.Y. Patil College of Engineering would like to invite you to Join our Webinar being conducted on *16 June @ 4 PM,* where we would be discussing *Strategies to Crack GRE & Score 330+!*

Wish to score 330+ in GRE? At Imperial, we have IIT Alumni, Verbal Masters & Counsellors who have done their MS in USA / Germany! We are here, the Team that can guide you along the 330+ path! No need to spend the lockdown with your attention distributed across multiple references, impeding your progress. Imperial will provide you with the focused acceleration you need toward your Dream University!

Competition has not eased one bit for further studies abroad and believing that COVID may have reduced the entry barriers, especially to prestigious institutions, would be a folly! Come 2021, the number of applicants will likely double! In that environment, what you do today will help differentiate you a lot from the competition!

18/06/20, 12:01 am - Aman Mulani: "Unprecedented, yet expected rise in Cyber Frauds."
Yes, this was expected. And there will be even more resurgence in cyber frauds and crimes.
If I say we can stop this altogether?
Yes, it's very simple, yet we have not been able to do this. People commiting cyber crime usually get away with it because they are not reported appropriately and the cyber authorities don't get cue about them.
So here we come to your rescue. If you spot any malicious website or page on instagram/Facebook, reporting isn't enough, you have to undertake much more steps to get the culprit behind bars. Here this amazing group has come to our rescue. 
Here's the contact number: 
+44 7451 222188
http://wa.me/+447451222188
You can report any issue regarding cyber crime to them and rest of things will be taken care of. This includes everything from online scams, fraudulent websites, WhatsApp/FB scams and all.
Even if you are a victim of cyber bullying, go ahead, it's a team of international cyber security experts. The team has decided to voluntarily use their knowledge and skills for the benefit of the society.
Be Safe and Sound!

22/09/20, 3:00 pm - Nikhil Agarwal Astronomy: *Hello Machine Learning Enthusiasts!*
Hope you are doing well in this pandemic!

Do you know computers are predicted to supersede not only manual labour but also mental labour in the near future?

Yes! The reason is the growing demand for intelligent computers, which can be acquired with the help of machine learning. It’s all about data and algorithms. It’s the collection of algorithms whose ultimate goal is to generate more accurate and persistent results.

Machine Learning is going to be the most demanding skill in the near future.

We ACM-W Chapter from Mody University of Science and Technology, brings you a *Machine learning workshop*, by amazing mentors of Code for Cause. Code for Cause is a community of awesome mentors whose primary focus is to provide guidance and mentorship to students. Not only for those who lack on-campus opportunities but also for those who lack awareness about the possibilities in the field. So, what are you waiting for? Grab the chance to learn from the expert mentors.
The registration for this webinar is free of cost!

06/01/21, 6:39 pm - Suwarna Patil Ma'am: Dear students, 
Greetings to you from Soft Skills Department of Dr. D .Y. Patil Educational Complex, Akurdi.Language skills can be a significant competitive advantage that sets you apart from your monolingual peers. They are among the top eight skills required of all occupations—no matter your sector or skill level—and the demand for bilingual professionals is rising exponentially.  The advantages of learning foreign languages are mushrooming as the world becomes increasingly globalized and bilingualism is now perhaps the most useful real world skill to ever exist .
In view of above we are going to start German and Japanese Languages training programme for the  academic year 2020-21. Interested students are informed to fill the details by using following link. Thank you,

13/03/21, 8:19 am - Gaurav Gupta Sir: Others do register for any of these training agencies today itself as it is starting from coming Monday.

This is for your benefit only,
If you will not register then it will be very difficult for you to get placed..

As per last year record those who have done the training, they placed in good companies, and with good package.

*Those who have not done this, they are still in the unplaced list.*

*You can talk to your seniors.*

So do register as early as possible.

14/04/21, 8:25 pm - Gaurav Gupta Sir: ✨When we think of facing an interviewer a chill rundowns the spine.✨
The chain of questions starts engulfing you like :

What if I get nervous?
What if I brag too much?
What if I don't know the answers to interviewers' questions?‼️


And what not!!!!!

Outcome 

Rejection Rejection Rejection!😨

But out of all this, we forget the key ingredient i.e. 

*What the recruiter wants?*
And who is the best person to enlighten us about this?? ✅
Well well, no other than,
 _*Ritesh Shergill*_
● *Vice president AWM Tech at JP Morgan Chase*
●Passionate technologists worked with some great establishments and tech.
●Published 2 Science fiction books in the Earth 2327 series 📚

17/09/21, 10:39 am - Amol Dhakane Sir TG Dypatil: *Payment Guidelines*

Dear all students,  
It is recommended to login through ERP website dypiemr.collpoll.com on laptop/PC and then do the payment instead of using Collpoll Mobile app. 

Also while doing payment, all must check bank transaction limit for Card/Netbanking/UPI etc and accordingly you can do payment in multiple transactions if there is limit of transaction. 

If still you are facing problem, you can try after some time with good internet speed.
